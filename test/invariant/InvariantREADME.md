## Sentiment Fuzz Suite

### Overview
Sentiment engaged Guardian Audits for an in-depth security review its leveraged lending protocol. This comprehensive evaluation, conducted from June 17th to June 27th, 2024, included the development of a specialized fuzzing suite to uncover complex logical errors. This suite was created during the review period and successfully delivered upon the audit's conclusion.

### Contents
BaseSentimentInvariant configures the Sentiment Protocol setup and actors used for fuzzing. 

All of the invariants reside in the following contracts:
* SuperPoolHandler.sol
* SuperPoolProperties.sol
* PoolHandler.sol
* PoolProperties.sol
* PositionManagerHandler.sol


### Setup And Run Instructions
To run invariant tests:
```shell
echidna test/invariant/invariants/SentimentInvariant.sol --contract SentimentInvariant --config echidna.yaml
```

### Changelog
To simplify gathering coverage, `SuperPool.accrue()` & `Pool.accrue()` are called at the beginning of select function handlers.
The preview functions do not account for pending interest and when pending interest was present the following invariants would not hold:
* SP-10
* SP-20
* SP-30
* SP-40

In the current state of the fuzzing suite, these invariants will hold due to pending interest being collected before any state changes are made.

***Note about liquidations:***
Due to the `_getMinReqAssetValue` (PO-19) issue of not requiring a position's asset list to have anything in it, many liquidations are DOSed and the following liquidation invariants do not reflect that.
